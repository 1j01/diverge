organic textploration

an experimental idea; **nothing yet**

type to choose a path, creating one if it doesn't exist

or browse paths by pointing with mouse/pen/touch/head/line-of-sight/whatever

similar paths that don't quite match could be lined up like "magnetic" strings, i.e.

	The quick fox jumped at the opportunity
	The qui   fox jumps     the
	       c n         over     lazy dog
	      k   w
	       bro

Markov text chains, paraphrasing utilities, and neural networks could suggest paths that don't exist yet
