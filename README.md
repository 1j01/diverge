*organic textploration*

<!-- I implore you to explore the text galore -->
<!-- where there's text, there's always more -->
<!-- where there's text, there's always more -->
<!-- there's always more, there's always more -->
<!-- there's always more... there's always more... -->

an experimental idea;
**nothing yet** but a filtered list
(with some fun transitions)

type to forge a path,

or browse paths by pointing with mouse/pen/touch/whatever

similar paths that don't quite match could be lined up like "magnetic" strings, i.e.

	The quick fox jumped at the opportunity
	The qui   fox jumps     the
	       c n         over     lazy dog
	      k   w
	       bro

### Providers

Providers can look at the path you're on and the cursor position and suggest alternative paths.

The basic provider returns paths from database of strings entered by users.

A Markov text chain or sentence autocomplete provider would return paths with text inserted at the cursor,
whereas a paraphrasing provider (possibly using a neural network?) could return strings with infix replacements,
making for paths that diverge and rejoin the current path.

### Evaluators

Do you value rhyme, alliteration, assonance?
Are fifthglyphs [vil<b>e</b> & <b>e</b>vil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AVoid5/),
or [good, top notch stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmboldenTheE/)?
<!-- (Subverting demonstration of those phrases by reversing the demonstrations) -->

Arbitrary writing constraints and softer nudges
can be interesting instruments of creativity.

Evaluators can be combined and weighted.

### Communities

I don't know what would work best
for the granularity and structure,
but it could have communities
with independent moderation and rules,
similar to Reddit,
and pages with seed texts...
and then maybe special rules could be applied to certain pages,
possibly based on tags...
and maybe some tags could only be set by moderators and some could be set by anyone...

A simpler model could be that
there are just pages
with seed text and rules
set initially by a user.

Either way, there'd be links, of course.

<!--
The evaluators can be used to just weigh suggested paths,
or can they also be hard or soft rules on paths you can enter.
Soft rules as in guidelines, or where there's a non-zero tolerance level.
-->

<!--
Is seed text the way to go?
If discovery is based on the prefix of the seed text,
you might be discouraged from making a minor change........
or reinterpretation of something........................... -->

### Long-form writing

An alternate (maybe not exclusive) direction for this project to take
could be towards longer-form writing like articles and even books.
In that case it should work inline,
and it would be more focused on *editing*,
rather than exploration.
(Memetic exploration,
or [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex)ploration if you will.)
